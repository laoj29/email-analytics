We have created an effective and powerful tool for personal email analytics by:<br />
1. Acquire and parse raw data
- Obtain data with .MBOX file format which can be downloaded from any Gmail account.
- Parse data with a Perl script to extract neccessary information.<br />
**Email: datetime & recipients**
2. Process and aggregate data
- Use a Python script to compact data into hour-based format<br />
**Format: count, hour, day, month, year, weekday, recipients**
3. Display
- A small piece is shown as below:
4. Add Filters
