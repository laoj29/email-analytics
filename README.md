# Email Analytics
This is a project for course Information Visualization, co-working with Sanford Moskowitz.<br />
<br />
We have created an effective and powerful tool for personal email analytics by:<br />
<br />
1. Acquire and parse raw data<br />
Obtain data with .MBOX file format which can be downloaded from any Gmail account.<br />
Parse data with a Perl script to extract neccessary information.<br />
**Email: datetime & recipients**<br />
<br />
2. Process and aggregate data<br />
Use a Python script to compact data into hour-based format.<br />
**Format: count, hour, day, month, year, weekday, recipients**<br />
<br />
3. Display<br />
A small piece is shown as below:<br />

<br />
4. Add Filters<br />
